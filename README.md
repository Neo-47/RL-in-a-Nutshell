This repo is dedicated for reinforcement learning papers and literature. I'll present summaries and highlights of different reinforcement learning papers and try to show the connections between them.

## **Value-based methods**
+ **Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning**.
  + [Summary](https://github.com/Neo-47/RL-in-a-Nutshell/tree/master/DQN%20/Human%20level%20control%20through%20deep%20RL) 
  + [Paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf)

+ **Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning**.
  + [Summary](https://github.com/Neo-47/RL-in-a-Nutshell/tree/master/DQN%20/Double%20Q-learning)
  + [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06461.pdf)
  

## **Policy-based methods**

+ **Policy Gradient Methods for Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation**.

  + [Summary](https://github.com/Neo-47/RL-in-a-Nutshell/tree/master/Policy%20Gradient/Policy%20Gradient%20Methods%20for%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20with%20Function%20Approximation)
